If it&#8217;s the goal of great science
fiction to boldly go where no man has gone before, an entry-level
problem for The Martian is that it seems to be planting its space
boots in some very recently trodden turf.</p>
<p>For Matt Damon, the whole movie is another lost in space pick-up
attempt, after his similar part in Interstellar. For Ridley Scott it&#8217;s
another disaster-strewn voyage into the cosmos, after his own return
to the genre with<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/prometheus-2/plot-cast-rumours-spoilers/"><b>Prometheus</b></a>.
Is this a new frontier to explore, or just a disco remix?</p>
<p>The difference from both of those movies is ambition (lower) and
tone (much, much lighter). Adapting the self-published<b> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/the-martian/andy-weir-author-interview/" target="_blank">novel by Andy Weir</a></b>, Scott and his
screenwriter, Lost and Cabin in the Woods scribe Drew Goddard, get the
premise speedily up and running: a manned mission to Mars, with six
astronauts tasked with bringing back samples, is thrown into disarray
when heavy weather blows in.</p>
<p>One of their number, botanist Mark Watney (Damon), is hit by flying
debris and thrown out of sight; his communications and life signs both
go dead; and the other five, played by Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara,
Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie and Michael Pe&#241;a, have no choice but to
abort their mission and head back to Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not dead,&#8221; the injured Mark reports on regaining
consciousness, in a first recorded missive which he has no means to
convey to Nasa. &#8220;Obviously.&#8221; That&#8217;s a very Goddard &#8220;obviously&#8221; &#8211; you
hear his smart, wisecracking voice constantly scanning the joint for
comic potential.</p>

<div gravityNodes="35" gravityScore="1771"><p><b>William Shakespeare's plays</b> have the reputation of being among the greatest in the English language and in <a href="/wiki/Western_literature" title="Western literature">Western literature</a>. Traditionally, the plays are divided into the genres of <a href="/wiki/Shakespearean_tragedy" title="Shakespearean tragedy">tragedy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shakespearean_history" title="Shakespearean history">history</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Shakespearean_comedy" title="Shakespearean comedy">comedy</a>; they have been translated into every major <a href="/wiki/Modern_language" title="Modern language">living</a> <a href="/wiki/Language" title="Language">language</a>, in addition to being continually performed all around the world.</p>
<p>Many of his plays appeared in print as a series of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Folios_and_Quartos_(Shakespeare)" title="Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)">quartos</a>, but approximately half of them remained unpublished until 1623, when the posthumous <a href="/wiki/First_Folio" title="First Folio">First Folio</a> was published. The traditional division of his plays into tragedies, comedies and histories follows the categories used in the First Folio. However, modern criticism has labelled some of these plays "<a href="/wiki/Shakespearean_problem_play" title="Shakespearean problem play">problem plays</a>" that elude easy categorisation, or perhaps purposely break generic conventions, and has introduced the term <a href="/wiki/Shakespeare%27s_late_romances" title="Shakespeare's late romances">romances</a> for what scholars believe to be his later comedies.</p>
<p>When <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> first arrived in London in the late 1580s or early 1590s, dramatists writing for London's new commercial playhouses (such as <a href="/wiki/Curtain_Theatre" title="Curtain Theatre">The Curtain</a>) were combining two different strands of dramatic tradition into a new and distinctively Elizabethan synthesis. Previously, the most common forms of popular English theatre were the <a href="/wiki/Tudor_period" title="Tudor period">Tudor</a> <a href="/wiki/Morality_play" title="Morality play">morality plays</a>. These plays, celebrating <a href="/wiki/Piety" title="Piety">piety</a> generally, use <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Personification" title="Personification">personified</a> moral attributes to urge or instruct the <a href="/wiki/Protagonist" title="Protagonist">protagonist</a> to choose the virtuous life over Evil. The characters and plot situations are largely symbolic rather than realistic. As a child, Shakespeare would likely have seen this type of play (along with, perhaps, <a href="/wiki/Mystery_play" title="Mystery play">mystery plays</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miracle_play" title="Miracle play">miracle plays</a>).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The other strand of dramatic tradition was <a href="/wiki/Classical_antiquity" title="Classical antiquity">classical</a> aesthetic theory. This theory was derived ultimately from <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>; in Renaissance England, however, the theory was better known through its Roman interpreters and practitioners. At the universities, plays were staged in a more academic form as <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> closet dramas. These plays, usually performed in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Latin_language" title="Latin language">Latin</a>, adhered to classical ideas of <a href="/wiki/Classical_unities" title="Classical unities">unity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Decorum" title="Decorum">decorum</a>, but they were also more static, valuing lengthy speeches over physical action. Shakespeare would have learned this theory at grammar school, where <a href="/wiki/Plautus" title="Plautus">Plautus</a> and especially <a href="/wiki/Terence" title="Terence">Terence</a> were key parts of the curriculum<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> and were taught in editions with lengthy theoretical introductions.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p />
<p />

<p>Archaeological excavations on the foundations of the <a href="/wiki/The_Rose_(theatre)" title="The Rose (theatre)">Rose</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Globe_Theatre" title="Globe Theatre">Globe</a> in the late twentieth century<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> showed that all London <a href="/wiki/English_Renaissance_theatre" title="English Renaissance theatre">English Renaissance theatres</a> were built around similar general plans. Despite individual differences, the public theatres were three stories high, and built around an open space at the centre. Usually polygonal in plan to give an overall rounded effect, three levels of inward-facing galleries overlooked the open centre into which jutted the stage&#8212;essentially a platform surrounded on three sides by the audience, only the rear being restricted for the entrances and exits of the actors and seating for the musicians. The upper level behind the stage could be used as a <a href="/wiki/Balcony" title="Balcony">balcony</a>, as in <i><a href="/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></i>, or as a position for a character to harangue a crowd, as in <i><a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar_(play)" title="Julius Caesar (play)">Julius Caesar</a></i>.</p>
<p>Usually built of timber, lath and plaster and with thatched roofs, the early theatres were vulnerable to fire, and gradually were replaced (when necessary) with stronger structures. When the Globe burned down in June 1613, it was rebuilt with a tile roof.</p>
<p>A different model was developed with the <a href="/wiki/Blackfriars_Theatre" title="Blackfriars Theatre">Blackfriars Theatre</a>, which came into regular use on a long term basis in 1599. The Blackfriars was small in comparison to the earlier theatres, and roofed rather than open to the sky; it resembled a modern theatre in ways that its predecessors did not.</p>

<p>For Shakespeare as he began to write, both traditions were alive; they were, moreover, filtered through the recent success of the <a href="/wiki/University_Wits" title="University Wits">University Wits</a> on the London stage. By the late 16th century, the popularity of morality and academic plays waned as the <a href="/wiki/English_Renaissance" title="English Renaissance">English Renaissance</a> took hold, and playwrights like <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Kyd" title="Thomas Kyd">Thomas Kyd</a> and <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe" title="Christopher Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a> revolutionised theatre. Their plays blended the old morality drama with classical theory to produce a new secular form.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> The new drama combined the rhetorical complexity of the academic play with the bawdy energy of the moralities. However, it was more ambiguous and complex in its meanings, and less concerned with simple allegory. Inspired by this new style, Shakespeare continued these artistic strategies,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> creating plays that not only resonated on an emotional level with audiences but also explored and debated the basic elements of what it means to be human. What Marlowe and Kyd did for tragedy, <a href="/wiki/John_Lyly" title="John Lyly">John Lyly</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_Peele" title="George Peele">George Peele</a>, among others, did for comedy: they offered models of witty dialogue, romantic action, and exotic, often pastoral location that formed the basis of Shakespeare's comedic mode throughout his career.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</sup></p>
<p>Shakespeare's Elizabethan tragedies (including the history plays with tragic designs, such as <i>Richard II</i>) demonstrate his relative independence from classical models. He takes from Aristotle and <a href="/wiki/Horace" title="Horace">Horace</a> the notion of decorum; with few exceptions, he focuses on high-born characters and national affairs as the subject of tragedy. In most other respects, though, the early tragedies are far closer to the spirit and style of moralities. They are episodic, packed with character and incident; they are loosely unified by a theme or character.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> In this respect, they reflect clearly the influence of Marlowe, particularly of <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tamburlaine_(play)" title="Tamburlaine (play)">Tamburlaine</a></i>. Even in his early work, however, Shakespeare generally shows more restraint than Marlowe; he resorts to grandiloquent rhetoric less frequently, and his attitude towards his heroes is more nuanced, and sometimes more sceptical, than Marlowe's.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> By the turn of the century, the bombast of <i>Titus Andronicus</i> had vanished, replaced by the subtlety of <i>Hamlet</i>.</p>
<p>In comedy, Shakespeare strayed even further from classical models. <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, an adaptation of <i><a href="/wiki/Menaechmi" title="Menaechmi">Menaechmi</a></i>, follows the model of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_comedy" title="New comedy">new comedy</a> closely. Shakespeare's other Elizabethan comedies are more romantic. Like Lyly, he often makes romantic intrigue (a secondary feature in Latin new comedy) the main plot element;<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> even this romantic plot is sometimes given less attention than witty dialogue, deceit, and jests. The "reform of manners," which Horace considered the main function of comedy,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> survives in such episodes as the gulling of <a href="/wiki/Malvolio" title="Malvolio">Malvolio</a>.</p>
