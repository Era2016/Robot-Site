* Website for Robot Competitions
  
** Requirements and Running

*** OS Prerequisites
I'll come back and manage the doc later.

** Settings
This site relies extensively on environment settings which will not work with
 Apache/mod_wsgi setups. It should be deployed successfully with both 
Gunicorn/Nginx and even uWSGI/Nginx.

For configuration purposes, the following table maps the 'robo' environment
 variables to their Django setting(It should be added to cloud in the future):
